Tube RSS : An unofficial London Underground travel delays feed creator

Note: this script deos not currently work due to changes on the TfL site.

Transport for London (TfL), operators of the London Underground (or Tube as it is more commonly known) designed a nice website but did
not provide rss feeds of live information (such as delays to the Tube). I wrote this to provide just that. Unfortunetly it proved popular 
enough to bring my machine to a grinding halt, and in any event since writing it TfL have changed their site *and* now provide rss feeds 
(of a sort).

I provide my code in case it proves useful to someone doing something similar.

Legal crap: 
I am not, and do not claim to be, connected with TfL or London Underground Limited. 
Do not use this for anything important, I accept no liability, use at your own risk, there be dragons, etc....
